# Cawbird 1.1.0

<a href="https://ibboard.co.uk/cawbird/#screenshots"><img src="./screenshot1.jpg" style="float:right; margin-left: 1em;" /></a>

[Cawbird](https://ibboard.co.uk/cawbird/) is a fork of the [Corebird](https://corebird.baedert.org/) Twitter client from Baedert, which became unsupported after Twitter disabled the streaming API.

Cawbird works with the new APIs and includes a few fixes and modifications that have historically been patched in to IBBoard's custom Corebird build on his personal Open Build Service account<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>.

## Packaging and installation

Cawbird packages are built in the [Cawbird Open Build Service project](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home:IBBoard:cawbird). They can be installed from the [Cawbird download page](https://software.opensuse.org//download.html?project=home%3AIBBoard%3Acawbird&package=cawbird).

When a tweet is focused (via keynav):

* `r`  - reply
* `tt` - retweet
* `f`  - favorite
* `q`  - quote
* `dd` - delete
* `Return` - Show tweet details
* `k` - Print tweet details to stdout (debug builds)

## Limitations

Due to [changes in the Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/accounts-and-users/subscribe-account-activity/migration/introduction), Cawbird has the following limitations:

* Cawbird will update every two minutes
* Cawbird does not get notified of the following actions when performed outside Cawbird, which will be refreshed on restart:
  * Unfavourite
  * Follow/Unfollow
  * Block/Unblock
  * Mute/Unmute
  * DM deletion
  * Some list changes

All limitations are limitations imposed by Twitter and are not the fault of the Cawbird client. They have affected [all third-party client applications](http://apps-of-a-feather.com/).

Cawbird is also unable to implement the following features because Twitter does not provide a way for third-party applications to get the data:

* Notification of Likes, RTs, quote tweets and any other interaction that appears in the "All" tab of twitter.com's Notifications but not in "Mentions"
  * No API is available for other notifications, only a [mentions API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/timelines/api-reference/get-statuses-mentions_timeline)
* DMs to Groups
  * Twitter's API only supports one-to-one DMs
  * Twitter explicitly [closed a request for this API](https://twitterdevfeedback.uservoice.com/forums/921790-twitter-developer-labs/suggestions/37689256-allow-access-to-dm-group-conversations-via-twitter) as "not a priority"
* Polls
  * The free API does not include polls as tweet "entities"
  * Twitter doesn't even mark posts so that we can direct people to the web
* Twitter's "[Bookmarks](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2018/an-easier-way-to-save-and-share-tweets.html)" system
  * No API is available
* Full threads in a single request
  * No API is available
* Replies older than seven days
  * The free search is limited to returning results from the last seven days
* All replies to a tweet
  * No API is available and the search results are not guaranteed to find all replies
* Twitter [Cards](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/overview/abouts-cards)
  * No API is available
  * Twitter doesn't even mark posts so that we can direct people to the web
  * This results in @TwitterDev [posting a message](https://mobile.twitter.com/TwitterDev/status/1222596295090757636) that many devs can't see!

## Known issues

There are no current known issues with running Cawbird.

Previously, the following issues have occurred that were outside of our control:

* Due to a [bug in GnuTLS](https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/issues/841#note_225110002), Cawbird has suffered from occasional TLS errors. This has been handled under [Cawbird bug 9](https://github.com/IBBoard/cawbird/issues/9) and GnuTLS have released a fix for the underlying problem
* Due to a [bug in GStreamer 1.16.1](https://github.com/IBBoard/cawbird/pull/42#issuecomment-539437887), Cawbird suffered from glitchy audio and video when playing media. This has now been fixed in GStreamer

## Translations

  Since February 2020, there has been a [Cawbird project on Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/cawbird/cawbird/dashboard/). Users can sign up on Transifex for free to help translate Cawbird.

## Contributing

  All contributions are welcome (artwork, design, code, just ideas, etc.) but if you're planning to
  actively change something bigger, talk to me first.

## Compiling Cawbird

### Compiling

Cawbird uses the Meson build system rather than the more archaic autoconf/make combination. Building is as simple as:

```Bash
meson build
ninja -C build
```

Note that executing `build/cawbird` may result in the error:

```Bash
Settings schema 'uk.co.ibboard.cawbird' is not installed
```

To correct, install the application:

```Bash
ninja install -C build
```

Cawbird installs its application icon into `/usr/share/icons/hicolor/`, so an appropriate call to `gtk-update-icon-cache` might be needed.

### Build Dependencies

* `gtk+-3.0 >= 3.22`
* `glib-2.0 >= 2.44`
* `json-glib-1.0`
* `sqlite3`
* `libsoup-2.4`
* `gettext >= 0.19.7`
* `vala >= 0.28` (makedep)
* `meson` (makedep)
* `gst-plugins-base-1.0` (for playbin, disable via --disable-video)
* `gst-plugins-bad-1.0 >= 1.6` or `gst-plugins-good-1.0` (disable via --disable-video, default enabled)
  * Requires the `element-gtksink` feature, provided by `gstreamer1.0-gtk` on Ubuntu-based systems,
    `gstreamer1-plugins-bad-free-gtk` on older RPM-based systems and `gstreamer1-plugins-good-gtk` on
    newer RPM-based systems
* `gst-libav-1.0` (disable via --disable-video, default enabled)
* `gspell-1 >= 1.2` (for spellchecking, disable via --disable-spellcheck, default enabled)

Note that the above packages are just rough estimations, the actual package names on your distribution may vary and may require additional repositories (e.g. RPMFusion in Fedora, or Packman in openSUSE)

If you pass `--disable-video` to the configure script, you don't need any gstreamer dependency but won't be able to view any videos.
